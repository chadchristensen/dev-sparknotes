# Web Performance Optimization

## Table of Contents
### [1. Minimize HTTP Requests](#1-minimize-http-requests-1):
* Combine files (CSS, JavaScript) to reduce the number of requests.
* Use CSS sprites for images to combine multiple images into a single file.

### [2. Optimize Images](#2-optimize-images-1):
* Compress images without losing quality (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim).
* Serve images in next-gen formats like WebP.
* Use responsive images (different sizes for different devices).

### [3. Enable Compression](#3-enable-compression-1):
* Use Gzip or Brotli to compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### [4. Leverage Browser Caching](#4-leverage-browser-caching-1):
* Set appropriate cache headers (e.g., Cache-Control, Expires) for static assets to enable caching.

### [5. Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML](#5-minify-css-javascript-and-html-1):
* Remove unnecessary characters, comments, and white spaces to reduce file sizes.

### [6. Reduce Server Response Time](#6-reduce-server-response-time-1):
* Optimize your server configuration.
* Use a fast web host and a content delivery network (CDN) to serve content faster.

### [7. Enable Keep-Alive](#7-enable-keep-alive-1):
Use persistent connections to reduce the latency of subsequent requests.

### [8. Optimize CSS Delivery](#8-optimize-css-delivery-1):
Load critical CSS inline for above-the-fold content.
Defer non-critical CSS to load later.

### [9. Prioritize Above-the-Fold Content](#9-prioritize-above-the-fold-content-1):
* Ensure that the content users see first is prioritized and loads quickly.
### [10. Use Asynchronous Loading for JavaScript](#10-use-asynchronous-loading-for-javascript-1):
* Load JavaScript files asynchronously to prevent them from blocking the rendering of the page.
  
### [11. Reduce Redirects](#11-reduce-redirects-1):
* Minimize the use of redirects as each redirect increases load time.

### [12. Optimize Web Fonts](#12-optimize-web-fonts-1):
* Use modern font formats like WOFF2.
* Limit the number of different font families and weights.

### [13. Implement Lazy Loading](#13-implement-lazy-loading-1):
* Delay the loading of images and videos until they are needed (i.e., when they come into the viewport).

### [14. Monitor Performance Regularly](#14-monitor-performance-regularly-1):
* Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, or WebPageTest to regularly check and improve performance.

### [15. Optimize Third-Party Scripts](#15-optimize-third-party-scripts-1):
* Limit the use of third-party scripts.
* Load them asynchronously and defer their loading where possible.

### [16. Use HTTP/2](#16-use-http2-1):
* Take advantage of HTTP/2 features for faster data transfer, such as multiplexing and server push.

### [17. Reduce DNS Lookups](#17-reduce-dns-lookups-1):
* Minimize the number of unique domains requested to reduce DNS lookup time.
  
### [18. Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)](#18-implement-content-delivery-networks-cdns-1):
* Use CDNs to deliver content from servers closer to the userâ€™s location.

### [19. Avoid Inline JavaScript and CSS](#19-avoid-inline-javascript-and-css-1):
* Separate JavaScript and CSS into external files to improve caching.

### [20. Improve Server Performance](#20-improve-server-performance-1):
* Optimize database queries and use efficient algorithms and data structures to reduce server processing time.
