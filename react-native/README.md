### 1. [Components and JSX](#1-components-and-jsx-1):
Understanding how to create and compose components using JSX is foundational. This includes functional components, class components, and props.

### 2. [State and Props Management](#2-state-and-props-management-1):
 Mastering how to manage state within components, how to pass data via props, and how to handle user input and events.

### 3. [Navigation](#3-navigation-1):
Learn how to implement navigation between screens using libraries like React Navigation, including stack, tab, and drawer navigators.

### 4. [Styling and Layout](#4-styling-and-layout-1):
Get comfortable with React Nativeâ€™s styling system, which is based on Flexbox, and how to create responsive designs that work on multiple screen sizes.

### 5. [API Integration and Networking](#5-api-integration-and-networking-1):
Understand how to make network requests using fetch or Axios, handle asynchronous data with Promises, and interact with APIs.

### 6. [Native Modules and Platform-Specific Code](#6-native-modules-and-platform-specific-code-1):
Learn how to leverage platform-specific code (iOS and Android) and how to use native modules to access device features like the camera or GPS.

### 7. [Debugging and Performance Optimization](#7-debugging-and-performance-optimization-1):
Get familiar with debugging tools (like React Native Debugger and Flipper) and learn how to optimize performance, such as handling large lists with FlatList and managing memory usage.

### 8. [State Management Libraries (e.g., Redux or Context API)](#8-state-management-libraries):
While basic state management can be done with React's built-in useState and useEffect, learning Redux or Context API will help manage more complex state across your application.
