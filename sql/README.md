## Basic Queries
Understanding basic queries is foundational to working with SQL databases. Here are the critical components:

1. SELECT Statements

* Syntax: The basic syntax for a SELECT statement is:
	
  ```SQL
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```
* Selecting Specific Columns: Itâ€™s essential to know how to select specific columns instead of using SELECT *. For example:
  ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM employees;
  ```

2. FROM Clause
   
* Syntax: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
	```SQL
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name;
	```
* Example:
	```SQL
	SELECT product_name, price
	FROM products;
	```

3. WHERE Clause
   
* Syntax: Used to filter records that meet certain conditions.
	```SQL
	SELECT column1, column2
	FROM table_name
	WHERE condition;
	```
* Operators: Common operators include =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, BETWEEN, LIKE, and IN.
  * Equality:
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
	```
  * Range:
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
	```
  * Pattern Matching:
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
	```
  * Set Membership:
	```SQL
	SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status IN ('Shipped', 'Pending');
	```

4. ORDER BY Clause
* Syntax: Used to sort the result set by one or more columns.
	```SQL
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
	```
* Example:
  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales'
  ORDER BY last_name ASC;
  ```

5. LIMIT Clause
* Syntax: Used to specify the number of records to return.
  ```SQL
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  LIMIT number;
  ```
* Example:
  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM customers
  ORDER BY sign_up_date DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

6. DISTINCT Keyword
* Syntax: Used to return only distinct (different) values.
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2
  FROM table_name;
  ```
* Example:
  ```SQL
  SELECT DISTINCT country
  FROM customers;
  ```

7. Aliasing
* Syntax: Used to give a table or a column a temporary name.
  ```SQL
  SELECT column_name AS alias_name
  FROM table_name;
  ```
* Example:
  ```SQL
  SELECT first_name AS 'First Name', last_name AS 'Last Name'
  FROM employees;
  ```
