# Blender

The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, suggests that 20% of efforts yield 80% of results. Applying this to learning Blender, you can focus on the following 20% of topics that will give you 80% of the essential knowledge:

## Table of Contents

### 1. [User Interface Mastery](#1-user-interface-mastery-1):

* Learn how to navigate Blenderâ€™s interface efficiently. This includes understanding the layout, hotkeys, and panels. Mastering this will speed up every other task.

### 2. [3D Modeling Basics](#2-3d-modeling-basics-1):
* Focus on basic modeling techniques like extruding, scaling, and manipulating vertices, edges, and faces. Learn the key modeling tools such as Knife, Loop Cut, and Mirror.

### 3. [Modifiers](#3-modifiers-1):
* Understand how to use essential modifiers like Subdivision Surface, Mirror, Array, and Boolean. These can significantly enhance your modeling efficiency and capabilities.

### 4. [UV Unwrapping & Texturing](#4-uv-unwrapping--texturing-1):
* Learn how to unwrap 3D models for texturing and how to apply textures to your models. This includes understanding UV maps, materials, and basic texture painting.

### 5. [Shading & Materials](#5-shading--materials-1):
* Get comfortable with creating and applying materials using the Shader Editor. Learn the basics of nodes, especially for creating realistic materials.

### 6. [Lighting](#6-lighting-1):
* Master the basics of lighting a scene, including the use of different light types (e.g., point, sun, area), and understanding how light interacts with materials.

### 7. [Rendering](#7-rendering-1):
* Understand the basics of rendering, including setting up a scene for rendering, adjusting render settings, and using both Eevee and Cycles render engines.
   
### 8. [Animation Basics](#8-animation-basics-1):
* Learn the fundamental principles of animation, including keyframing, the timeline, and the graph editor. Focus on simple object animations and camera movements.

### 9. [Rigging Basics](#9-rigging-basics-1):
* Familiarize yourself with basic rigging concepts for animating models, including creating simple armatures and understanding weight painting.

### 10. [Add-ons & Customization](#10-add-ons--customization-1):
* Learn how to use and install key add-ons that can enhance your workflow, like LoopTools and Node Wrangler. Also, understand how to customize the Blender interface to fit your personal workflow better.
By focusing on these areas, you'll cover the essential tools and concepts that form the foundation of most tasks in Blender, enabling you to work efficiently and creatively on a wide range of projects.
